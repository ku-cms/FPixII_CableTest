TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -4.319 ns between design_1_i/led_ctl_0/U0/cnt_reg[0]/C (clocked by clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0) and design_1_i/led_ctl_0/U0/led_o_reg[7]/D (clocked by clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#2 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -4.756 ns between design_1_i/led_ctl_0/U0/cnt_reg[0]/C (clocked by clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0) and design_1_i/led_ctl_0/U0/led_o_reg[6]/D (clocked by clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#3 Warning

There is a large setup violation of -5.560 ns between design_1_i/led_ctl_0/U0/cnt_reg[0]/C (clocked by clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0) and design_1_i/led_ctl_0/U0/led_o_reg[5]/D (clocked by clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
